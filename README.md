# Hi, I'm João 👋

I'm a Senior Software Engineer who loves building clean, scalable, and well-structured systems.

I started coding early and have been evolving ever since — from classic .NET WebForms and MVC applications to modern .NET 8/9 architectures with Blazor, OData, CI/CD pipelines, cloud integrations, and automated testing.

I care about code quality, good architecture, and building things that actually make sense long-term.
